# Coding Challenges 
This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges.

## Why did I make this repo?
Every day, the first thing I do is solve a coding challenge. My goal is to continuously improve my coding skills through this routine.

I like to compare my old solutions to the new ones I come up with. This is why I decided to track and publish every coding challenge I solve.

## What I learned
The biggest lesson I have learned from tackling this never-ending supply of questions is the realization that there is always room for growth. It's okay to be unable to answer a question, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
